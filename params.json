  "body": "Who am I? I am a positive, inquisitive, people-oriented person on a learning journey.  I'm curious about people and what makes them tick.  Because when I understand what is important to people, I can provide them with more tailored information and data to help them make better, more informed decisions.  There is so much information out there,it seems a shame not to use it to our advantage!  \r\n\r\nIt should come as no surprise then that I'm particularly interested in education and life-long learning. The more we understand, the better choices we are able to make. With so much information out there, changing rapidly, it's exciting that to think that I get to keep learning and discovering!\r\n\r\nI'm fascinated by storytelling that uses data to create more compelling narratives and I strongly believe in tailoring to an audience, to create stories and result in action. I enjoy getting people from different backgrounds together because I believe we each have something to contribute and when you incorporate different perspectives, you get a richer, more robust outcome.  I get a kick out of knowing people feel they have a part in a story.  That we're on a journey together.",
